# Δ Delta

Welcome to the code repository for [Δ Delta](https://garden.arash.codes)! Δ Delta is my digital garden meant to be a consolidation of raw thoughts and ideas. It's powered by the amazing [Quartz 4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) and is the next step in my foray into digital gardening after making a previous, smaller one called Lectern for school notes.

## Motivations

I've been interested in the concept of [learning in public](https://garden.arash.codes/social/learning-in-public) for quite some time now, but I've always held back in terms of doing anything about it. I realised that there isn't really a predefined or set way to do so, so I spent quite a lot of time figuring out the kind of medium that might help me achieve this in a comfortable way.

I stumbled across Quartz from quite a while back, and I like how it makes it easy to document knowledge — especially with apps like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) — and opted to use it as a base.

## Contributing

Since this is a personal project, **contributions are not actively accepted** at this point in time. If you have thoughts about the content in the site, stay tuned! I'm looking at implementing [Giscus](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/comments) support soon for reactions + comments on individual notes.
