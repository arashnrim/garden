title: "Just because we can build it, should we?"
description: "Thoughts of an Engineering student that likes Philosophy After spending a while in engineering school, I’ve noticed that we are often trained to focus on how to build things better, faster, and cheaper. Yet the question of whether we should build these systems at all is sometimes left unexamined."

# Annotations

> If a self-driving car crashes, who is responsible? The engineer who wrote the algorithm? The company that deployed it? Or the person in the driver’s seat, who isn’t technically in control?

> From this, we can see that ethical questions arise at every step in autonomous systems, from traffic accidents to complex dilemmas akin to the famous ‘trolley problem’ for example, should a vehicle sacrifice its passenger to save pedestrians?

> Furthermore, responsibility in engineering is often spread out, with multiple engineers of different levels and roles involved in building and deploying systems; a phenomenon known as the Diffusion of responsibility.
