# Annotations

> collective intellectual humility, meaning the tendency of a collective’s members to attend to each other’s intellectual limitations and to the limitations of the cognitive efforts of the collective

> Although intellectual humility is usually thought of as an individual trait, few of our intellectual endeavours occur in isolation from other people. Much of human reflection, interpretation, learning, deliberation and decision-making takes place in groups.

> Social dynamics frequently get in the way of collective intellectual humility. These include expectations of conformity, a lack of diverse thinking, or simply the social decorum that keeps us from shouting out each other’s weaknesses.
