# Annotations

> There is no ending where we reach the same destination, although I would fold the world over to make our paths meet. But physics doesn’t change its rules just for love and when the time comes, I’ll be the one to let go.

> It feels strange to be at peace with the fact that you’ll be gone, even if it hasn’t happened yet. I know grief so well it feels synonymous with my existence, but when it comes to you, there is no grief at all.

> And even when you are gone, the joy will remain. I want to say: I promise I’ll remember you fondly. I don’t because it feels more intimate than a confession.

> My phone has become a graveyard: names like tombstones, deleted texts like ghosts. I try to remove numbers from my contacts, burial after burial after burial, but when my fingers reach the knife, it won’t commit to the murder.

> Gratitude becomes the color with which I paint your memory; this is intentional. Change is hard for me becomes change is a human inevitability, but I can see how your presence has guided the trajectory.
