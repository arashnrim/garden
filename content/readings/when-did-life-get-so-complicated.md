# Annotations

> Superstition generally doesn’t appeal to me — I like to think everything is malleable, and admitting things are out of my control is just an excuse for laziness. Trying really hard has gotten me to where I am today — why would I ever leave anything up to anyone but myself?

> Call it God but I prefer to call it my friends and family being the greatest ever. Surrendering to the fact that, no matter what, I will figure out a way to go on and that I don’t have to do it alone doesn’t make me superstitious but it does make me a little stitious.

> Growing up, whenever I’d start bragging about myself, my mom always said “You’re floating towards the sky. I’m here to bring you back down to earth.”

> When I’m feeling down on myself, it’s easy for me to try to help others for the wrong reasons, to feel good about myself rather than actually wanting the best for others.

> Close companions who, when I mentioned I didn’t want to tell them about my day when they were feeling down even though it was good, responded saying that that’s especially when they want to hear about my day so they can feel happy through me.

> Letting someone really know you is like giving someone a map of your entire being, all your doubts, fears, hopes, and insecurities, a delicate web that you’ve spun for as long as you’ve been alive. Love is handing them some scissors and praying they don’t decide one day to cut through all of it.

> I’m now less scared of things going wrong, and more scared of never giving anything enough of a chance to go right. Assume the best, prepare for the worst.

> It’s the people that really love you back that’ll see past the words you say and stare directly into your soul to check that your intentions are pure.

> You never really fall out of love with someone. I guess that’s why they call it getting over someone, not getting rid of someone.

> Sometimes it’s just out of your control — the universe has a plan for everyone, and not every plan involves you. Again, your brain knows this but your heart disagrees.

> Having fun is easy, and comes naturally, but being able to disagree and show each other our worst sides yet still reconcile is hard and takes courage.

> I now realize that to be known and noticed is to be loved

> “Am I acting this way because I really want to and it’s core to me, or for some other external reason related to my past or my surroundings?”
