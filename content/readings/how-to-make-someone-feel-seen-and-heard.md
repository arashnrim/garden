# Annotations

> Imagine if, instead of being judged, you felt understood. What if the rejection you feared was supplanted by the acceptance you long for?
The term psychologists use to describe what you’re envisioning in this situation is validation.

> Validation is not praise. Praise is a judgment – it says: I like the way you look or perform. Validation demonstrates acceptance – it says: I accept who you are independent of how you look or perform. When people claim that we shouldn’t rely on external validation, they are confusing validation with praise.

> Validation is not problem-solving. Problem-solving focuses on changing someone’s reaction by suggesting solutions to specific problems, eg, ‘I know you didn’t do well on that spelling test; why don’t we try reviewing your words on the way to school next time?’ Validation, on the other hand, focuses on acknowledging the situation and the validity of someone’s response to it: ‘You studied so hard; I can understand why you are upset.’

> Validation is not agreement. I can validate why someone would have concerns about protecting an unborn fetus even if I am pro-choice. If the idea of validating an opinion you disagree with makes you nervous, rest assured that validating another person’s perspective does not necessarily function to reinforce it.

> Importantly, focusing on the valid parts of someone’s response will make you much more effective in challenging the invalid aspects of it.

> The framework I developed for teaching validation skills is called the ‘validation ladder’. It includes three sections of skills, arranged in order of strength: mindfulness, understanding, and empathy. Mindfulness here means simply observing without judgment. Understanding suggests that you see a person’s reaction, or some part of it, as logical or justifiable. And empathy means connecting with another person’s emotions.

> For each skill set, try to practise the skills yourself when opportunities come up in everyday interactions, and pay attention when others use them: podcast interviews and late-night shows are rife with examples of validation.

> Attending means paying attention and listening without judgment, in a way that shows interest and cultivates understanding.

> One way to go about Attending is through non-verbal behaviours. The big four to focus on are:

eye contact;
head nodding;
gestures (hand to the chin in thoughtfulness, etc); and
proximity (leaning in or being physically close).

> Copying has you reflect or mirror another person’s words or behaviour.
