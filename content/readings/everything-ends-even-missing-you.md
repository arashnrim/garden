# Annotations

> There is a lot of pain left here that I don’t know how to make beautiful, don’t yet want to turn into art because that would mean you’re really gone.

> But the thing about closure is that you can’t force it to happen, no matter how much you will it to.

> I have dragged my sadness up the street and through the door and into my home. I have taken my sadness 3,000 miles away and back — seen it use the welcome mat and take off its coat. I saw it once in the cracks of an old ceramic mug in the morning light and in my mother’s old grandfather clock that hangs in our living room. I have let it tuck me in and wake me up before dawn. This has been happening for a while now.

> What do you do when you get so close to what you want, you end up on the other side of it? Hey, what’s a good return address on all this love left over? Can I still get a kiss for the road?
