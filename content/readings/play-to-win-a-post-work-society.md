# Annotations

> Play is the act of enjoying the process, the means to the end. To have as much fun as possible along the way. Quoting Kernel, to “turn life into a canvas, rather than a graph with checkpoints”.

> Doing ‘nothing’ within a productivity-obsessed environment can, in fact, help to restore communities, both locally and beyond.

> Play allows us to create environments where saying ‘no’ is okay. By definition, nobody forces you to play. Play is what allows us to create local spaces of abundance.

> Games, as Suits defines it, are “goal-directed activities in which inefficient means are intentionally chosen.”

> Playing a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome self-imposed obstacles.

> The resolution appears to be the fact that activities which one views as instrumentally valuable (work) can, for another, be intrinsically valuable (play).
