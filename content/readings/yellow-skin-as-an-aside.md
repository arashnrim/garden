# Annotations

> You stop going to bars so you don’t have to listen to people compare you to characters they assume you know.

> You think of how it would break her heart to say you want to go home — and when you say home here, you mean China — because she spent her whole life running from it. You think of how when you lived in China, you thought of going home — and when you say home here, you mean America — daily.

> She isn’t wrong; Chinese is your second language for good reason. But she isn’t right, either; the way people look at you is proof there is a hyphen attached to “American.”

> Now, you feel resentful of the length of the hyphen — 21 hours and 6,700 miles.
