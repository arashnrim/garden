# Annotations

> Spoiler: The two tools are better together and can work in harmony to create a better experience for developers and operations teams.

> It is never a great idea to only understand one tool and its approach and philosophy. Instead, you should open your mind to understanding why different tools and platforms exist, and why successful organizations may be using both.

> Terraform is the infrastructure as code offering from HashiCorp. It is a tool for building, changing, and managing infrastructure in a safe, repeatable way.

> Ansible is an IT automation tool. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks such as continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates.

> If you are unfamiliar with immutable infrastructure, it is defined as instances that do not change over time or are unable to be changed.
