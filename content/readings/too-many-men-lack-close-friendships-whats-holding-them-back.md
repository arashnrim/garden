# Annotations

> Recent research indicates that one in five men in the US and one in three men in the UK lack close friendships entirely. Two-thirds of young American men say: ‘No one really knows me.’ Nearly half of men in the UK feel they cannot confide in a friend about their problems. American men are 50 per cent less likely to report receiving social support – having someone check in on them or offer help when they need it – in a week than women, and also report having fewer friendships than they did 30 years ago.

> But it is the quality of men’s bonds, measured against the human psychological need for deep social connection, not necessarily the number of their friendships, that paints a gendered picture of social deprivation. What men often lack is not friends, but closeness.

> Later, when someone in his circle made similar attempts at physical or emotional affection, Navid caught himself flinging the same word at them. ‘If I’m calling you that, there’s no way I can be it,’ he explained. It’s a hallmark of how men surveil each other’s behaviour: the punished becomes the punisher.
