👋 Welcome to Δ Delta[^1], [Arash’s](https://arash.codes) digital garden!

Learning in public has always been the theoretical spark for this garden, but the rationale has eventually spread to curating a personal space where I can gather and share knowledge vulnerably — free from performativeness and embracing imperfection.

> [!info]
> 
> I'm trying out something new to bring this and [my blog](https://blog.arash.codes) together as [[two-halves-one-ecosystem|sister projects]] that frequently interact with each other. Watch this space as I move things about and figure stuff out!

Digital gardens are exciting because there's no proper starting point. To move around, feel free to look at the graph view to the right or below (depending on your device!). Because digital gardens are imperfect and always a work-in-progress, different notes are grouped like this:

* [[spark|✨ Sparks]] — these are notes that are brand-new and have the least time spent on writing. They're due for more work and writing, but they're exciting starts that will grow with more time spent.
* [[ember|🔥 Embers]] — these are notes that have progressed since being sparks with some time and effort put in. They're not that complete just yet and require more time and elaboration to work on them.

Alternatively, feel free to check this hand-curated list of the things I've been up to now:

- [[homelabbing|Exploring homelabbing]], where I try to bring together different devices for a nice experimental sandbox
- Seeing how potent [[large-language-models|LLMs]] can be in surfacing manipulative language packed in a [[semantica|browser extension]]
- Deepening my relationship with [[digital-minimalism|digital minimalism]] and doing my own thing while spinning down my use of my daily tech
- Experiencing major post-game depression with the masterpiece that is [[clair-obscur-expedition-33|Clair Obscur: Expedition 33]]

Have fun exploring my garden!
