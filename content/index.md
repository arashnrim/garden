ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Î” Delta[^1], [Arashâ€™s](https://arash.codes) digital garden!

I've been fond of learning in public for a long time now, and thought to start a digital garden as a viable step forward in doing that. This digital garden may be specific and focused on tech for now, but I hope that it can grow into something that transcends disciplines.

> I'm trying out something new to bring this and [my blog](https://blog.arash.codes) together as [[two-halves-one-ecosystem|sister projects]] that frequently interact with each other. Watch this space as I move things about and figure stuff out!

Digital gardens are exciting because there's no proper starting point. To move around, feel free to look at the graph view to the right or below (depending on your device!). Because digital gardens are imperfect and always a work-in-progress, different notes are grouped like this:

* [[spark|âœ¨ Sparks]] â€” these are notes that are brand-new and have the least time spent on writing. They're due for more work and writing, but they're exciting starts that will grow with more time spent.
* [[ember|ðŸ”¥ Embers]] â€” these are notes that have progressed since being sparks with some time and effort put in. They're not that complete just yet and require more time and elaboration to work on them.

Alternatively, feel free to check this manually-curated list of the things I've been up to now:

- [[homelabbing|Exploring homelabbing]], where I try to bring together different devices for a nice experimental sandbox
- Seeing how potent LLMs can be in surfacing manipulative language packed in a [[semantica|browser extension]]

Have fun exploring my garden!
