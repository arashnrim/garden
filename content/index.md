Welcome to Delta, [Arashâ€™s](https://arash.codes) digital garden!

I am fond of learning in public for a long time now, and I figured that a digital garden could be a viable step forward in doing that. This digital garden may be specific and focused on tech, but I hope that, over time, it can grow into something that transcends disciplines.

Digital gardens are exciting because they offer you a non-linear way of navigating. For starters, try looking at the **graph view** to the right to see connected notes. Because digital gardens are imperfect and always a work-in-progress, different notes are grouped like this:

* [[tags/spark|âœ¨ Sparks]] â€” these are notes that are brand-new and have the least time spent on writing. They're due for more work and writing, but they're exciting starts that will grow with more time spent.
* [[tags/ember|ðŸ”¥ Embers]] â€” these are notes that have progressed since being sparks with some time and effort put in. They're not that complete just yet and require more time and elaboration to work on them.
* [[tags/beacon|ðŸ’¡ Beacons]] â€” these are notes that are more or less complete and fulfilled. As embers continue to be fanned, they'll ignite to shine bright and be well-written proses. This is also what you may find on *`function()`*, the "traditional" and structured blog.
