> Hedonic adaptation refers to the notion that after positive (or negative) events (i.e., something good or bad happening to someone), and a subsequent increase in positive (or negative) feelings, people return to a relatively stable, baseline level of affect (Diener, Lucas, & Scollon, 2006).

This term generally describes how we perceive to return back to a normalised baseline of happiness even after major positive or negative events in our lives. Some instances of this happening include:

- Winning lotteries â€” where the initial high of the thrill eventually gets lowered back down to the baseline
- Academic or work-related achievements
