A little life is one that breaks the norm of superficiality, and one where meaning is found through the many things we do as days go by. I'm fond of this definition by Catlyn Richardson in her Substack post I came across:

> a little life, in all its simplicity, doesn’t seek validation from the outside. instead, it crafts its own meaning in the quiet, deliberate acts of everyday living—making breakfast, tending a garden, sharing a book with a friend.

I think this kind of life has an inherent sense of [[social/minimalism|minimalism]] to it. There are parallels about rejecting the idea of proving your worth to others and achieving goals for such things; rather, it is more introspective, personal, and private.
