It's generally easy to define what it is — a focus around having *less* — but what's more important and intriguing is the philosophy that some people can have behind it.

There seems to be a few repeating ideas w.r.t. minimalism:

* intentionality — that what you're keeping and doing aligns with what we hope to do; removing distractions, ensuring that the environment is right for us to be clear about what we're doing

	> [Minimalism] is a life that forces intentionality upon us. As a result, it forces improvements in almost all aspects of your life.
	> 
	> Intentionality looks different for everybody, as no two individuals are the same, but it requires each of us to dive deeper and become more introspective about our values and passions.

	> Minimalism is about more than just possessions, though. Minimalism is focusing on and committing to the fundamentals, instead of wasting time, money, or energy on details.
