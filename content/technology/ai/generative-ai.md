A subset of artificial intelligence that looks at generating content based on trained data. Current developments in the gen AI space have produced multi-modal forms of gen AI models, meaning that they can ingest and produce textual, visual, and sometimes even aural content.

[[large-language-models|Large language models]] are an example of gen AI models because they train on textual data and, as a result, are able to produce convincing textual content based on the prompts provided to them.
