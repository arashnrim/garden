> What does it mean to have your own personal space on the Internet? What fits the bill?

I came across an event from the National Library Board about [crafting a handmade web](https://nlb.libcal.com/event/5858205) and signed up for it. In preparation for that chat, I decided to go down a rabbit hole behind [one of the speakers' Are.na pages](https://www.are.na/lina-l/websites-im-perceiving) — and as I dive deeper, the clearer the idea of a personal internet spoke out to me.

I'm particularly drawn to one of the websites in her collection: [A Website is a Room](https://a-website-is-a-room.net/). It acts as a directory that points to other sites that contains some quality of "slowness, quiet, and/or gathering". **So is a personal internet one that contains *soul*?**

A personal internet has been in my circle for a while already, and [I've even written a bit about it](https://blog.arash.codes/posts/breaking-out-of-prose#reading-widely-refining-taste) (found it only in Jan 2026 after re-reading my blog posts)! Maybe 2026 is the year when I learn more about what a personal internet can look like — and create that own space I've craved for so long on my own.

# Discussions from Beyond Text: Crafting a Handmade Web

> [!question] Pre-event questions
> 
> - How do you think [[generative-ai|gen AI]] plays a role in crafting a handmade web? Does it seek to collaborate or replace?

## Lina's sharing

[Visit Lina's site!](https://amalinalai.github.io/precipice) There's so much to explore there alone.

- Using the web as a way to share what you're curious + passionate about
- 404 pages: liminal spaces, how can we reimagine them?
	- Interactivity: Lina used her 404 page as a text-based adventure game — pretty interesting!
- Lina's definition on the handmade web
	- Mindful + organic in exploring the internet; branching rather than a singular stream
	- Active roles in defining internet experience
	- Exploring rabbit holes; link-to-link based on interested
	- Unguided by algorithms but by interest
	- Doing something rewarding + fun for yourself
	- Slow-paced, tended by care + effort

## Rafi's sharing

- https://negentropicfields.info/T-01_RA
- Art recommendations
	- Age of You — radical engineering of human experience by digital interfaces
	- The Age of Earthquakes
- Collapse of binaries: public vs private (feelings once private now very public and online); real vs fake; individual vs crowd
- Post-naïve internet era: new movement of creators looking at the internet with a new lens — see https://co-matter.com/project/welcome-to-the-post-naive-internet
- [Trust](https://trust.support/): turning of tools (e.g. Twitch for live streaming) into productive non-money-making experiences
- Decentralised communities — forum boards, then converted to centralised platforms with decentralised communities (e.g. Discord)
- Dark forest analogy again — the idea that a civilisation keeps to itself in a "dark forest", preventing communication w/ other civilisations
- [Perfectly Imperfect](https://pi.fyi)
- [Are.na](https://are.na)
- [Substack](https://substack.com)
- Rebuilding platforms that reject monetisation and the idea of creating for others
- Is whatever you do online performative?

## Panel discussion

- Language used in the internet is based on books (e.g. "webpage", "content page")
- The internet was the first way of reading non-linearly; we regress now with algorithmic systems telling us what to read next
- Visual culture has become more prominent — in the past, we relied on text as a way to interact and bond; today, we replaced that with images and being able to *see* the other end
- Intentions shape the language; that's how Substack has a "carry my own voice" vibe
- Digital gardens: people are uploading notes onto websites ([[index|heeeeey]]) — Zettelkasten system to craft a web of knowledge
	- So, in a way, pursuing digital gardening is a rejection of the commercialisation of yourself; you let your curiosity decide what you do, and that is readable by anyone on the internet
- Pulling (based on interest, e.g. [[digital-gardening|digital gardens]]) vs pushing (against your will, e.g. ads); agency with how you interact with the internet
- Hand-made vs existing platforms — to what extent is something considered hand-made?
	- Lina has a more liberal perspective to what the hand-made web can be; coding can be time-intensive and difficult to pick up; anything cared for by a human (e.g. digital gardens) or has the spirit of exploration
	- Rafi also has a liberal idea of the hand-made web; at the end of the day it's the *niat* — intention — that matters
- Aesthetic of the "hand-made web": nostalgic '90s vibe; how can you tell if someone is just borrowing the old tech aesthetic vs actually living the ethos of crafting the hand-made web?
	- THIS!!! I've been thinking about this!!!
	- The '90s presented the idea of "a new world" — much more so in Singapore, which experienced mass globalisation in that decade
	- We can appreciate both happening at the same time: appreciating the visual language and using that to create your web hand-made
	- There can be a discernible difference between an individual embracing the joy of the visual aesthetic of a time passed vs an organisation that uses that same aesthetic to sell you a vibe from that time
	- Rafi brought up [CARI](https://cari.institute/)
	- It can be something authentic even if someone approaches the idea of a hand-made web as an aesthetic first — is that where I am, or have I moved beyond that?
- Does the hand-made web risk become artisanal (only accesible to those who can afford the time and cultural capital + the privilege)?
	- Slow-surfing has now become a privilege — already experiencing the internet beyond the accelerated narratives is already a privilege in itself (e.g. because of responsibilities)
	- An appeal of the hand-made web is the decentralised + democratic nature: you make the space what you want it to be, but there is the privilege of accessing the internet, having the time + attention to curate this space for yourself, etc.
	- A problem of the hand-made web: it's based off an internet of the past where computers/desktops are the primary medium; it's now an added responsibility to consider accessibility + different device factors
- Economic considerations can drive the change of intention behind something
- Is [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org) an example of a successful hand-made web?
	- Lina views that it is by her definition; Wikipedia is not algorithmic-driven and cultivated by humans
	- Rafi agrees
- I asked a very haphazardly-phrased question about whether the hand-made web benefits from remaining its nicheness
	- The panel replied that, economically, it does make sense — considering platform costs, maintenance, and other things that economically require it to remain niche — but in the spirit of the word, not necessarily

> [!note] Post-event reflection
> 
> I think that the event covered a lot of different bases that surrounds the hand-made web, and it gave a lot of clearer insight about it as a whole. Lina shared more about the philosophy behind the hand-made web, along with the things she's made along the way that were her foray into it. Rafi shared more about the design and considerations behind the hand-made web.
> 
> I now know that the hand-made internet, and a personal internet, is one that understands the effort of labour in its creation — the idea that human hands were responsible for its becoming, and that it resembles the person who created it.
> 
> The panel discussion highlighted the idea that even slow-surfing is a privilege today with the little free time we have, but it's all the more interesting then that so many people are curating their own personal corners of the internet — rejecting the notion that we have to visit the same big websites everyday to connect with each other.
