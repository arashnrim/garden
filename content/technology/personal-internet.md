> What does it mean to have your own personal space on the Internet? What fits the bill?

I came across an event from the National Library Board about [crafting a handmade web](https://nlb.libcal.com/event/5858205) and signed up for it. In preparation for that chat, I decided to go down a rabbit hole behind [one of the speakers' Are.na pages](https://www.are.na/lina-l/websites-im-perceiving) — and as I dive deeper, the clearer the idea of a personal internet spoke out to me.

I'm particularly drawn to one of the websites in her collection: [A Website is a Room](https://a-website-is-a-room.net/). It acts as a directory that points to other sites that contains some quality of "slowness, quiet, and/or gathering". **So is a personal internet one that contains *soul*?**

A personal internet has been in my circle for a while already, and [I've even written a bit about it](https://blog.arash.codes/posts/breaking-out-of-prose#reading-widely-refining-taste) (found it only in Jan 2026 after re-reading my blog posts)! Maybe 2026 is the year when I learn more about what a personal internet can look like — and create that own space I've craved for so long on my own.
